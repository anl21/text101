Okay, this is your best chance to talk with your crush that you've been stalking for months.
She's looking for someone to go to prom, you saw her while she's sitting one of the tables in the canteen and she's looking at you.
What's your next move?

1.Go and show her your house that you've created on Minecraft and then ask to add her on Discord.
2.Go and have a mental breakdown.
